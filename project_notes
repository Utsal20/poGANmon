Potential GAN candidates-

Notes-
Training data is 56x56 PNGs with lots of empty (white) pixels, meaning a CNN layer might not even be necessary.

Potential Issues / random ideas -
-Low amounts of training data. Could extract sprites from other Pokemon (or anything) games as well
    (same sprite, but drawn differently, at different levels of detail in different games).
-Training data augmentation by flipping the sprites, or recoloring them, etc.
-Could experiment with different GAN architectures, Graphical models (RBMs, Boltzmann Machines), or VAEs.
